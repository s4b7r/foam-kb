# s4b7r's Foam knowledge base

**ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my new Foam Knowledge Base!**

To make your own see [Foam template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template).

Beware; this is not a highly readable text, but a lot of notes, thoughts, ..., parts are also non-english.

Also, take everything with a big grain of salt. I add spontaneous thoughts and findings here, sometimes out-of-context, and maybe with unmentioned caveates, that are just in my head so far.

**Look out!** Links are still flaky!

Links to the parent folder redirect to notes that are currently out of scope for this public KB. Maybe they will be migrated here later.
